Many Flutter developers run into mysterious **Gradle or Kotlin-related build errors** ‚Äî especially when switching between projects or Flutter versions. One sneaky reason?

> **Flutter might not be using the Java version from `JAVA_HOME`, but instead the one bundled with Android Studio.**

In this guide, you‚Äôll learn how to:

- ‚úÖ Check your Java version
- ‚úÖ Check what Java Flutter is using
- ‚úÖ Configure Flutter to use the correct JDK
- ‚úÖ Reset to Android Studio‚Äôs JDK if needed

---

## üîç 1. Check Your Java Version

```bash
java --version
```

Expected output (for example):

```bash
openjdk 17.0.12 2024-07-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 17.0.12+0)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 17.0.12+0, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Then verify your JAVA_HOME:

```bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

Example:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk@17/17.0.12/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
```

## üîç 2. Check What Java Flutter Uses (Especially with FVM)

Even if your JAVA_HOME is set correctly, Flutter might still be using Android Studio‚Äôs built-in Java.

To find out:

```bash
fvm flutter doctor --verbose | grep Java
```

You might see something like:

```bash
‚Ä¢ Java binary at: /Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/bin/java
‚Ä¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.4+...)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This means Flutter is not using the Java you installed ‚Äî it‚Äôs using Android Studio‚Äôs bundled JDK (Java 21 in this case).

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Tell Flutter to Use Your Installed Java (e.g., Java 17)

To fix this, run:

```bash
fvm flutter config --jdk-dir $JAVA_HOME
```

This sets the JDK path explicitly for Flutter builds.

Then verify it:

```bash
fvm flutter doctor --verbose | grep Java
```

You should now see your system Java path from /opt/homebrew/....

## üîÑ 4. Revert to Android Studio‚Äôs Built-in Java (Optional)

If you want to switch back to using the JDK bundled with Android Studio, just run:

```bash
fvm flutter config --clear
```

Now Flutter will once again use the JDK from:

```bash
/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Bonus: Set JAVA_HOME in .zshrc or .bash_profile

Add the following to your shell config:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Then apply it:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bash_profile
```

By being deliberate about which Java Flutter uses, you‚Äôll avoid version mismatches and mysterious build errors ‚Äî especially when working across different Flutter versions or Android Gradle Plugin setups.

Working with multiple Java versions can be tricky, especially when Flutter projects silently default to the Android Studio JDK. Knowing how to inspect and configure which JDK Flutter uses can save hours of debugging time.

Whether you're building legacy projects or working with the latest Flutter version, keeping your environment in check ensures smooth builds and faster iteration. If you found this guide helpful, consider bookmarking it or sharing it with your team!
